# theme_etcobase

ETCOBase is a Moodle 3.9.11 theme developed to modernise and bring the current theme in line with the ETCO branding guidelines.

Developed from ShiftBase which is in turn a child theme of Boost. Shiftbase included styles for the customisations to the ETCO moodle. ETCOBase is not a child theme of ShiftBase.

To install, place all files in /theme/etcobase/ directory and visit /admin/index.php in your browser. 

Further development would be required for Moodle 4.0 support.
